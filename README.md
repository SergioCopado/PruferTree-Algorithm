# PruferTree: Algorithm for Generating and Decoding Prüfer Codes
This project implements a set of Python functions to work with Prüfer codes, a sequence that uniquely represents a labeled tree. The goal is to enable encoding and decoding of trees using their Prüfer code—a useful tool in graph theory and data structures.
